# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Optimizer

A comprehensive collection of metaheuristic algorithms for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This project implements and compares various optimization approaches to find near-optimal solutions for TSP instances.

## 🎯 Overview

The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic NP-hard optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. This project implements multiple metaheuristic algorithms to solve TSP instances efficiently.

## 🧬 Implemented Algorithms

### ✅ Genetic Algorithm

A population-based evolutionary algorithm that uses selection, crossover, and mutation operators to evolve solutions over generations.
