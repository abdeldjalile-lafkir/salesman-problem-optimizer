# Problem Optimization Metaheuristics

A comprehensive collection of metaheuristic algorithms for solving optimization problems. This project implements and compares various optimization approaches to find near-optimal solutions for different problem instances.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository focuses on implementing metaheuristic algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms, Cat Swarm Optimization, and more. Each algorithm is designed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Knapsack Problem, and others.

## 🧬 Implemented Algorithms

### ✅ Genetic Algorithm

A population-based evolutionary algorithm that uses selection, crossover, and mutation operators to evolve solutions over generations.

- **Location**: `{problemName}-genetic-algorithm/`
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented
